Application:
 - Guest update by Sel/Lunaretic [https://github.com/Lunaretic]
 - Skin Specular maps are now editable again for non-Au Ra races, and are viewable again in the ModList view.
    - The shared skin_m texture is now always referred to as a 'specular', to match the Au Ra version.
 - Added Search Bar to Make Modpack Menu
    - Search supports Wildcards via Asterisk(*), and 'Or' via Pipes(|)
 - Search for Model menu is now resize-able.
 - UI now defaults focus to search bars in menus where they are available.
 - Added Human Readable Error Messages for common start-up errors.
 - Broken TexTools config files will now be automatically reset.
 - XIV Mod Archive added to Repos menu.
 - Added Icon ID Search Menu
 - Added Export Settings Menu
 - Version Number updated to 1.9.9.0
 
3D:
 - Left Rings are now able to be viewed/modified.
 - Vertex Color is now imported/exported correctly.
 - Vertex Alpha is now imported/exported correctly.
    - As a work-around due to inconsistency with DAE parsers/exporters, Vertex Alpha is stored in the X(U) channel of UV3.
 - UV, Vertex Color, and Vertex Alpha data are now dummied up with default values, in the event that it does not exist in the incoming DAE file.
 - 3D Meshes now support multiple UV Coordinates and Normals per-Vertex.
 - For Gear and Character Models, UV1 Data is now automatically moved to the UV[1,-1] quadrant, if it is not already in that quadrant.
 - BiNormal/Tangent data is no longer required in the DAE file, since TT recalculates them anyways.
 - Added error message for mesh groups exceeding maximum size.
 - Added status message display after importing/enabling/disabling a model.
 
 Bug Fixes:
 - Fixed a bug with Modpack Import that would cause it to break if the uncompressed modpack size was greater than ~4GB.
 - Fixed a bug with importing that would allow DAT files to exceed the appropriate size.
 - Fixed a bug with Model Importing that would cause model indices to be thrown off if there was extraneous unused UV/Normal/Vertex Color/etc. data.
 - Fixed a bug with DAE imports that would cause a crash if the meshes had extra data channels in them (ex. extra UV channels).
 - Fixed a bug that would cause the 3D Model display to revert back to the default item after using import/enable/disable.
 - Autodesk Collada exported DAE files can now be imported.
 
Known Issues:
 - Skeleton files may need updating for some newer items. (Ex. Some Hairstyles and Bonewicca pieces)
